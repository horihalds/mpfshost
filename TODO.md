# TODO

Ordered by priority. Each task is independent and sized for one agent session. Before you start, read `AGENTS.md`.
When you finish a task, run the done checklist, then delete the task from this file in the same commit.

Every task's acceptance criteria include, without repeating them: `ninja -C build` is warning-free, `ctest --test-dir
build --output-on-failure -j8` passes, changed C++ files pass `clang-format --dry-run --Werror`, and the docs touched
by the change are updated.
